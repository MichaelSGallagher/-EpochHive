	Description:
		Improved Plant Spawner - Plant Patch Spawner
		Event spawns a random number of plants based on plant type.
		Prefers "Hill" locations and restricts Jammers and Protected Trader Zones.
		Plants now decay after 20 minutes and marker will change to brown at 50%.
		Plant patch marker will turn red after one plant is picked
		Plants and marker will cleanup after all plants in a patch are picked or die due to decay.

	Improvements and or bugfixes and other contributions are welcome via the github:
